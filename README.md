# SKID | Skills x Ideas

## Where Skills and Ideas Connect

This is a website for people with skills to collaborate with people with ideas.
This project was created as my capstone for the CodingNomads Django Web Development Course.

## Features

The goal of this project was to create two directories:

1. for users who have skills in any field.
2. for users who have good ideas but who may not have the skills to turn those ideas into reality.

Users can sort both the USERS directory and the IDEAS by the *Skill*, *Material*, or *Type of Work* that they are looking for.

## TODO

*This project is still in progress. I will continue to add the following features so that SKID can be useful of a website as possible.*

- Deploy website
- Allow users to add images to Ideas.
- Create a more robust search and filtering system for users and ideas.
- Add comments to Ideas.
- Add internal messaging system for users.
- Add Markdown formatting to Ideas

The tagging system I used for the *Skill*, *Material*, and *Type of Work* tags was adapted from the [CtrlZ Blog](https://ctrlzblog.com/how-to-add-tags-to-your-blog-a-django-manytomanyfield-example/) by Alice Ridgway.
